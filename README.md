# Bioinformatics-Final-Project.-
Group members: John Campbell - Justin Lawless - Eric Boheen
# Mystery Bacterial Genome Project
## Starting Data
-Illumina HiSeq 2500, paired-end, 250 bp sequencing reads
## Pipeline Process
1. Cleanup of Sequencing Artifacts
   -Removal of Adapters
   -Removal of Low quality reads
2. Genome Assembly
3. Genome assesment with quality scores
4. Identification of Organism
5. Genome filtering
6. Visualization of Genome
## Project Goal
- Genome assembly of unknown bacteria species 
+ Identification of species
* Create viusal representation of genome structure
